# Push Protected - GitHub Action

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

_**Push to "status check"-protected branches.**_

Push commit(s) to a branch protected by required [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks) by creating a temporary branch, where status checks are run, before fast-forward merging it into the protected branch, finally removing the temporary branch.

> **Note**: Currently this action _only_ supports status checks that are GitHub Action status checks, i.e., no third-party status checks are currently supported (like, e.g., protecting a branch with Travis CI checks).
> This is expected, however, to be added in the future.

## Update your workflow

To successfully have the required status checks run on the temporary branch, you _may_ need to add it to the workflow(s) that is/are responsible for the required status checks.

If you are using `on: [push]` and not

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
```

or similar, i.e., if you are running the workflow(s) for _all_ kinds of push actions, **there is no need to update your workflow(s)**.

_However_, if you are filtering on which branch/tag names trigger your workflow(s), then keep reading.

In order to not have to continuously update the yml file(s), the temporary branches all have the same prefix: `push-action/`.
The complete name is `push-action/<RUN_ID>/<RANDOM>-<RANDOM>-<RANDOM>`, where `<RUN_ID>` is the unique GitHub Actions run ID for the current workflow run, and the `<RANDOM>` is generated using the built-in Bash function, i.e., the `$RANDOM` variable.

Getting back to adding the temporary branch(es) to your workflow(s)'s yml file(s), it can be done like so:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'push-action/**'
```

An example can also be seen in this action's own [test workflow](.github/workflows/test_status_checks.yml).

## Notes on `token` and user permissions

If you are using this action to push to a GitHub [protected branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches), you _need_ to pass a [personal access token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line), preferrably as a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets), to the `token` input.
This can be done as such:

```yml
name: Pushing to the protected branch 'protected'
uses: CasperWA/push-protected@v2
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.PUSH_TO_PROTECTED_BRANCH }}
  branch: protected
```

**Note**: If you are _not_ pushing to a protected branch, you can instead use the [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) secret, which is auto-generated when you use GitHub Actions.
I.e., `token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.

The reason why you can not use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret when pushing to a branch that is protected by required status checks, is that using this as authentication does not trigger any webhook events, such as 'push', 'pull_request', etc.
This event trigger is a **MUST** for starting the required status checks on the temporary branch, which are necessary to run in order to be able to push the changes into the desired branch.

The PAT should have a scope appropriate to your repository:

- Private: _repo_
- Public: *public_repo*

It is recommended to not add unneccessary scopes to a PAT that are not needed for its intended purpose.

Note, the scopes mentioned above are only guidelines.
You may need to specify more or other scopes for your specific use case, depending on your role within a specific organization and/or repository.
For more information about scopes, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

### PAT user permissions

The user that the PAT represents **MUST** have "admin" permission to the repository in order to handle protected branches: determine which checks are running/finished and to toggle the "require review"-protection.

If the PAT represents the repository owner, there are no issues, however, if the PAT represents a collaborator, the collaborator **MUST** be given the "Admin" role.
This can be done under the "Settings" tab in the repository and then going to "Collaborators & teams".
To understand what the "Admin" role allows the user to do, you can see the "Repository roles" page, which is also found under the "Settings" tab in the repository.

## Usage

This action is inspired by [`ad-m/github-push-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-push) and to ease its use, it implements some of the same functionality.
The inputs `branch`, `force`, `tags`, and `token` are similar, where the `token` input has been renamed from `github_token`.
The `ad-m/github-push-action` input `directory` and `repository` are the only unsupported inputs.
The `repository` input is not supported, since this action expects you to deal with the current repository for which the action is running.

To use this action, the workflow is also similar to `ad-m/github-push-action`.

First, you **MUST** use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) action to checkout your local repository if you wish to make changes to it before pushing these changes to `branch`.

Second, you then make your changes.
Either as an explicit step of the workflow or you can run a separate script that incorporates all your changes.
If you wish to add tags or similar this can also be done now.

Finally, you run this action, specifying the inputs to your needs (see overview of all inputs below), and the action will take care to create a temporary branch with your changes, where the status checks will run, before merging it into your target branch (`branch` input), effectively "pushing" your local changes to the protected branch.

Below is an example of a workflow for releasing a Python package to PyPI.
It will run when a GitHub release is published.
It will then run the Bash script .ci/update_version.sh with .ci/ as the working directory.
This action will make sure the changes introduced by the Bash script are pushed to the `main` branch before building the source distribution and releasing to PyPI.

Note, any `git commit` and tag updating needs to happen in the Bash script or in an extra step in between running the Bash script and this action.

```yml
name: Release to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types:
      - published

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Push to protected branch
    steps:
    - name: Checkout local repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Update version
      run: ./update_version.sh
      working-directory: .ci/

    - name: Push to protected branch
      uses: CasperWA/push-protected@v2
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.PUSH_TO_PROTECTED_BRANCH }}
        branch: main
        unprotect_reviews: true

    - name: Build source distribution
      run: python ./setup.py sdist

    - name: Publish on PyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master
      with:
        user: __token__
        password: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_ON_PYPI }}
```

## Inputs

All input names in **bold** are _required_.

| Name | Description | Default |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| **`token`** | Token for the repo.<br>Used for authentication and starting 'push' hooks. See above for notes on this input. | |
| `branch` | Target branch for the push. Mutually exclusive with "ref".<br>Example: `"main"`. | `main` |
| `ref` | Target ref for the push. Mutually exclusive with "branch".<br>Example: `"refs/heads/main"`. | |
| `force` | Determines if `--force` is used. | `False` |
| `tags` | Determines if `--tags` is used. | `False` |
| `interval` | Time interval (in seconds) between each new check, when waiting for status checks to complete. | `30` |
| `timeout` | Time (in minutes) of how long the action should run before timing out, waiting for status checks to complete. | `15` |
| `sleep` | Time (in seconds) the action should wait until it will start "waiting" and check the list of running actions/checks. This should be an appropriate number to let the checks start up. | `5` |
| `unprotect_reviews` | Momentarily remove pull request review protection from target branch.<br>**Note**: One needs administrative access to the repository to be able to use this feature. This means two things need to match up: The PAT must represent a user with administrative rights, and these rights need to be granted to the usage scope of the PAT. | `False` |
| `debug` | Set `set -x` in `entrypoint.sh` when running the action. This is for debugging the action. | `False` |
